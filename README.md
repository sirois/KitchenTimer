# KitchenTimer
This program makes use of custom controls in Visual Basic. A "Single Timer" control is defined and used to create a program that can time 4 elements independently while you're busy working in the kitchen!
The 6 buttons at the bottom add the corresponding amount of time to the selected timer. (The selected timer is a different colour than the others).
Timers may not go over 99:59, and only appropriate buttons will be enabled. (Eg, the "Stop" button will not be enabled if the timer is not running)
